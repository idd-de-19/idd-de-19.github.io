				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<p>Interaction Design is an interdisciplinary field merging design 
				skills such as user experience, interface development and graphic 
				design with coding fundamentals to create meaningful experiences 
				between the user and digital platforms such as social media, websites, 
				wearables and mobile devices.</p>

				<p>George Brown College’s School of Design relocated to a new state-of-the-art 
				facility in 2019. Located within the Daniels Waterfront—City of the Arts 
				complex at Queens Quay East and Jarvis Street, our School of Design’s new 
				home expands our Waterfront Campus, and is immersed in a vibrant, mixed use 
				community. The modern space is about much more than classrooms and lecture 
				halls—it offers hands-on collaborative working spaces and labs developed to 
				encourage students and industry partners to push the boundaries of design and 
				user experience.</p>
